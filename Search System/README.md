# HelpMate AI – Building an Effective Search System
## Overview

HelpMate AI is an intelligent semantic search system designed to retrieve relevant information based on the meaning of user queries rather than exact keyword matches. The system leverages text embeddings and LLM-powered retrieval techniques to deliver accurate and context-aware search results.

This project focuses on improving traditional search by using modern AI-based information retrieval methods.
